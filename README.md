# TradeStation -> MetaTrader (M1) Converter

Small Tkinter GUI to convert TradeStation .txt data files to the format expected by MetaTrader (M1).
It shifts each barâ€™s timestamp from close (TS) to open (MT) by subtracting 1 minute.
Date stays MM/DD/YYYY; time stays HH:MM. Output is saved next to the input with suffix _MT.

This could be use to import data into StrategyQuant (SQX) and use the Metatrader engine instead of Multicharts engine.

## Features

* Input: comma-separated TXT from TradeStation.

* Output: same layout and date/time format; filename suffixed with _MT.

* No external dependencies (Python standard library only).

## Requirements

* Windows (recommended).

* Python 3.8+.

## Run the script
`python main.py`


A window will open. Select your TradeStation TXT and click Convert.

Tip: Double-clicking main.py also works if .py files are associated with Python.

## Build a standalone .exe with PyInstaller

1) Install PyInstaller:

`pip install pyinstaller`


2) Build the GUI executable (no console window):

`pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name TS_to_MT main.py`


3) The executable will be created at:

`dist/TS_to_MT.exe`
